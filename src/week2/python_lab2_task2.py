Lab 3.2 – Comprehensions and Transformations

Goals:
- Practice list, set, and dictionary comprehensions.
- Transform and filter data concisely.

Instructions:
Given the list:
    numbers = [3, 8, -2, 7, 0, -5, 10]

1. Create a list `squares` with the square of each number.
2. Create a list `positives` containing only positive numbers.
3. Create a set `even_squares` of the squares of even numbers.
4. Create a dictionary `cubes` mapping each number to its cube.
5. Print all results.

# 1. Squares of each number
squares = [n**2 for n in numbers]

# 2. Only positive numbers
positives = [n for n in numbers if n > 0]

# 3. Set of squares of even numbers
even_squares = {n**2 for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0}

# 4. Dictionary mapping number → cube
cubes = {n: n**3 for n in numbers}

# 5. Print results
